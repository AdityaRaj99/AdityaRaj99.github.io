In a reversal, Facebook now says that plan has changed, and users who don&#x2019;t accept the updated policy actually <em><em>won&#x2019;t</em></em> see limited functionality (<a href="https://thenextweb.com/news/whatsapp-says-it-wont-limit-functionality-if-you-refuse-its-privacy-policy-for-now">via <em><em>TNW</em></em></a>).</p><p>&#x201C;Given recent discussions with various authorities and privacy experts, we want to make clear that we will not limit the functionality of how WhatsApp works for those who have not yet accepted the update,&#x201D; a WhatsApp spokesperson said in a statement to <em><em>The Verge</em></em>. WhatsApp tells <em><em>The Verge</em></em> that this is the plan moving forward indefinitely.</p><p>The rollout of the policy <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22233257/whatsapp-privacy-policy-update-delayed-three-months">has been a confusing mess</a>, and raised concerns that WhatsApp would begin sharing more of users&#x2019; personal data with Facebook. (Some WhatsApp user data, such as users&#x2019; phone numbers, is already shared with Facebook, a policy that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/25/12638698/whatsapp-to-start-sharing-user-data-with-facebook">went into place in 2016</a>.) WhatsApp has stressed this is not the case, though &#x2014; the policy update is regarding messages sent to businesses via WhatsApp, which may be stored on Facebook&#x2019;s servers.</p><p>The majority of users who have seen the new policy have accepted, <a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/what-happens-when-our-terms-and-privacy-policy-updates-take-effect/?lang=en">the company says in a support article</a>. This article also notes that you&#x2019;ll get reminded about the new policy if you haven&#x2019;t accepted it, and that&#x2019;s still the case now, WhatsApp said in its statement.</p><p>&#x201C;We will continue to remind users from time to time and let them accept the update, including when they choose to use relevant optional features like communicating with a business that is receiving support from Facebook,&#x201D; WhatsApp said. &#x201C;We hope this approach reinforces the choice that all users have whether or not they want to interact with a business.&#x201D;</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Instagram making changes to its algorithm after it was accused of censoring pro-Palestinian content]]></title><description><![CDATA[<blockquote>The company says it will begin ranking original and re-shared content equally</blockquote><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/05/blog2.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="920" height="613" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2021/05/blog2.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/05/blog2.jpg 920w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Facebook-owned Instagram has made changes to its algorithm after a <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/facebook-employees-bias-arabs-muslims-palestine">group of its employees reportedly complained</a> that pro-Palestinian content was not viewable for users during the conflict in Gaza.

Instagram typically surfaces original content in its stories before reposted content, but will now begin to give equal weighting to both, the company confirmed to <em><em>The Verge</em></em> on Sunday.</p><p>As reported by <em><em>BuzzFeed News</em></em> and the<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/f2b394e5-d0c5-45e5-ba96-130865b02ce7."> <em><em>Financial Times</em></em></a>, the Instagram employee group had made numerous appeals about content that had been censored by Instagram&#x2019;s automated moderation, such as posts about the al-Asqa mosque being mistakenly removed. The employees didn&#x2019;t believe the censorship was deliberate, according to <em><em>FT</em></em>, but one said that &#x201C;moderating at scale is biased against any marginalized groups.&#x201D;</p><p>The change is not only in response to concerns over pro-Palestinian content, a Facebook spokesperson said in an email to <em><em>The Verge</em></em>, but the company realized the way the app functioned&#x2014; bubbling up posts that it believes its users care about most&#x2014; led people to believe it was suppressing certain points of view or topics. &#x201C;We want to be really clear&#x2014; this isn&#x2019;t the case,&#x201D; the spokesperson said. &#x201C;This applied to any post that&#x2019;s re-shared in stories, no matter what it&#x2019;s about.&#x201D;</p><p>Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram have been criticized over the past several weeks about how they have surfaced &#x2014; or not surfaced&#x2014;content around the conflict between Israel and Palestine. Earlier this month <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/qj8b4x/twitter-said-it-restricted-palestinian-writers-account-by-accident">Twitter restricted the account of a Palestinian writer</a>, which it later said was done &#x201C;in error.&#x201D; And Instagram ended up apologizing after many accounts were <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/5/7/palestinians-criticise-social-media-censorship-over-sheikh-jarrah">unable to post Palestine-related content</a> for several hours on May 6th, a move that <a href="https://twitter.com/mosseri/status/1390764509019607040?s=20">head of Instagram Adam Mosseri tweeted</a> was due to a &#x201C;technical bug.&#x201D;</p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Yesterday we experienced a technical bug, which impacted millions of people&#x2019;s stories, highlights and archives around the world.

</figure><p>Instagram says it has repeatedly heard from users who say they are more interested in original stories from close friends than they are in seeing people who reshare others&#x2019; photos and posts. That&#x2019;s why it prioritized original stories, the spokesperson said. &#x201C;But there&#x2019;s been an increase&#x2014; not just now but in the past as well &#x2014; in how many people are resharing posts, and we&#x2019;ve seen a bigger impact than expected on the reach of these posts,&#x201D; the spokesperson said. &#x201C;Stories that reshare feed posts aren&#x2019;t getting the reach people expect them to, and that&#x2019;s not a good experience.&#x201D;</p><p>The spokesperson added that Instagram still believes users want to see more original stories, so is looking at how to focus stories on original content through new tools.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Intel’s latest 11th Gen processor brings 5.0GHz speeds to thin and light laptops]]></title><description><![CDATA[<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/05/blog1.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="920" height="613" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2021/05/blog1.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/05/blog1.jpg 920w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge</figcaption></figure><p>Intel made a splash earlier in May with the launch of its first <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22423545/intel-tiger-lake-h-mobile-processors-11th-gen-laptops">11th Gen Tiger Lake H-series</a> processors for more powerful laptops, but at Computex 2021, the company is also announcing a pair of new U-series chips &#x2014; one of which marks the</p>]]></description><link>http://localhost:2368/blog-1/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">60b5156db4be471fdc0a872e</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Aditya Rajput]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 31 May 2021 17:07:45 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/05/blog1.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="920" height="613" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2021/05/blog1.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/05/blog1.jpg 920w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge</figcaption></figure><p>Intel made a splash earlier in May with the launch of its first <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22423545/intel-tiger-lake-h-mobile-processors-11th-gen-laptops">11th Gen Tiger Lake H-series</a> processors for more powerful laptops, but at Computex 2021, the company is also announcing a pair of new U-series chips &#x2014; one of which marks the first 5.0GHz clock speed for the company&#x2019;s U-series lineup of lower voltage chips.</p><p>Specifically, Intel is announcing the Core i7-1195G7 &#x2014; its new top of the line chip in the U-series range &#x2014; and the Core i5-1155G7, which takes the crown of Intel&#x2019;s most powerful Core i5-level chip, too.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/2/21408718/intel-11th-gen-tiger-lake-cpu-processor-announcement-laptops-fall">Like the original 11th Gen U-series chips</a>, the new chips operate in the 12W to 28W range. Both new chips are four core / eight thread configurations, and feature Intel&#x2019;s Iris Xe integrated graphics (the Core i7-1195G7 comes with 96 EUs, while the Core i5-1155G7 has 80 EUs.)</p><p>The Core i7-1195G7 features a base clock speed of 2.9GHz, but cranks up to a 5.0GHz maximum single core speed using Intel&#x2019;s Turbo Boost Max 3.0 technology. The Core i5-1155G7, on the other hand, has a base clock speed of 2.5GHz and a boosted speed of 4.5GHz. Getting to 5GHz out of the box is a fairly recent development for laptop CPUs, period: Intel&#x2019;s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/23/18512501/intel-9th-gen-laptop-desktop-processors-5ghz-update-specs-speed-features">first laptop processor to cross the 5GHz mark</a> arrived in 2019.</p><p>Along with the new processors, Intel has also announced its latest 5G modem solution for laptops &#x2014; a new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/4/18250061/intel-qualcomm-m-2-5g-modules-computer-pc-laptop">M.2 card</a> that device makers will be able to incorporate into their designs, called the Intel 5G Solution 5000. (While Intel famously sold off its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/25/8909671/apple-intel-5g-smartphone-modems-acquisition">smartphone 5G division to Apple</a>, Intel has continued its efforts in other areas of the next-generation connectivity standard.)</p><p>The new modem is a collaboration between Intel, Mediatek (which is handling the modem firmware) and Fibocom (which is actually manufacturing the modules), and will offer sub-6GHz 5G support and integrated eSIM technology. Intel says that Acer, Asus, and HP will all be offering laptops combing Intel&#x2019;s Tiger Lake chips and new 5G Solution 5000 cards later this year.</p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
